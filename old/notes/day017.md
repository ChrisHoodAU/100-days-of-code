# Creating Custom Classes
Class is a Blueprint

pass to skip the line
Capitalise the Class name

# Attributes, Constructors & __init__()
You can attach attributes to an object, even if it's not part of the Class definition
    However, you should probably define things during creation
Use a constructor - initialise the object. Set things to starting values
Use the __init__(self):
    Every time you create an object, the init statement is called and all things are run
pass variables to the init function
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.param = param
then
    my_thing = Thing("name")
you can init variables in the init, default values instead of being passed a creation value. Think when something will start at 0.

# Methods
A function within a Class definition.
They do the same thing.

use self when referring to the object that is being instanciated
