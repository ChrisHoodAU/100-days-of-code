# Scope and number guessing game
Variables declared in the main program are available in functions (implicit global)
Variables declared in functions aren't available outside the function

This also applied to functions, you can't reference functions declared inside other functions from outside

No Block Scope
ie
variables inside loops or branches are members of either Global or Function scope

A variable created inside a function is only available in the function.
A variable created in a while, if is available for the whole scope

# How to modify a Global variable
write 'global <variable>' inside functions to modify the variable.
not a great idea in general.
Read, don't Write Global scope.

Do a function input/output instead.

# Global Constants
variables defined at the top and never changed
Use ALL_UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORES for consts
