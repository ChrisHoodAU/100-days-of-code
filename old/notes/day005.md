# Loops, Range and Code Blocks

# For loop
for item in list_of_items:
    Do the thing on the item

fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# anything that follows a : based on indenting is a part of the if, loop etc.

# for loops and the range() function
range - generate a range of numbers to loop through

for number in range(a, b): #a to b, not including b
    # defaults to increment of 1
    print(number)

for number in range (a, b, c): step in increments of c
    print(number)

you can stack ifs in a condition with and
if blah and blah
