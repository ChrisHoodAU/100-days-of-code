# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1) -->
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: April 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working with strings and variables in Python

**Thoughts** A refresher on the fundamentals of strings, input/output and variables. Takes me back to Uni days.

### Day 2: April 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Data types, mathematical operators & string manipulation

**Thoughts** Picked up a couple of useful operators (+= etc) that I wasn't aware of, also casting variables.

### Day 3: April 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Conditionals

**Thoughts** Very much rehashing things I already know, but getting the syntax muscle memory is important.

### Day 4: April 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Randomisation and Nested Lists

**Thoughts** Remember - lists are indexed at 0 in python!

### Day 5: May 01, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Loops

**Thoughts** Ranges, Loops. Remember to be mindful of where they start and what they include. It's also not as complex sometimes. Think: lists instead of strings for random

### Day 6: May 02, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Functions

**Thoughts** Differences between for and while loops, defining functions and invoking them - for the moment without input or outputs.

### Day 7: May 03, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Hangman project

**Thoughts** Breaking the project down into small components really helped in completing the whole thing. Use flow charts to describe the program before starting.

### Day 8: May 04, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Function Parameters & Caesar cipher

**Thoughts** Neat tricks to condense similar functions down. Also remember tools like modulo in the kitbag. Positional vs Keyword arguments.

### Day 9: May 05, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Dictionaries and Nested Lists

**Thoughts** Interval comparison x >= number >= y. Dictionaries, nice to properly learn things I have already come across. Will have to play around with dicts a bit more to get them 100% in the mind

### Day 10: May 06, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Functions with Outputs

**Thoughts** Functions with returns and recursion. Again, not covering anything I haven't already seen but a good review.

### Day 11: May 07, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Blackjack Capstone Project

**Thoughts** Putting everything together in a project. Didn't write the most efficient code, could have collapsed some repeated actions into functions but it did work.

### Day 12: May 08, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Variable Scope

**Thoughts** Where variables are included in the scope and where they are not. Got the project done in a fairly clean manner, leveraging recursion, functions, variables etc.

### Day 14: May 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Higher / Lower project

**Thoughts** Putting all the previous lessions into action. Still feeling like I'm not quite getting things as clean as I could, but the code works.

### Day 15: May 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coffee Machine project

**Thoughts** Starting to get a bit smarter about iterating over dicts rather than doing big branches.

### Day 16: May 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Object Oriented Programming

**Thoughts** A blast from the past - OOP coming screaming back from Uni days. Read the doco and understand what methods the class brings!

### Day 17: May 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Creating Classes

**Thoughts** Get a grasp on what attributes the object has and you can rule the world!

### Day 18: May 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Turtles, Tuples and GUIs

**Thoughts** So that's what a tuple is! Many ways to skin a cat, read the methods.

### Day 19: May 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Instances, State and Higher Order Functions

**Thoughts** Functions being used by functions, and multiple instanciations of Classes. Neat using a list to contain the instances, rather than individually named ones.

### Day 20: May 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: The Snake game

**Thoughts** Got to a point where the snake responds to input. Need to review the part where the snake is bound together. Move the non-head segments to their neighbour, move the snake.

### Day 21: May 17, Monda

**Today's Progress**: The Snake game part 2

**Thoughts** Class inheritance - defining classes from classes, then slicing. Funny how inheritance seems to be making more sense this time around.
