**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 5: May 01, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Loops

**Thoughts** Ranges, Loops. Remember to be mindful of where they start and what they include. It's also not as complex sometimes. Think: lists instead of strings for random

### Day 7: May 03, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Hangman project

### Day 8: May 04, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Function Parameters & Caesar cipher

**Thoughts** Neat tricks to condense similar functions down. Also remember tools like modulo in the kitbag. Positional vs Keyword arguments.

### Day 9: May 05, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Dictionaries and Nested Lists

**Thoughts** Interval comparison x >= number >= y. Dictionaries, nice to properly learn things I have already come across. Will have to play around with dicts a bit more to get them 100% in the mind
