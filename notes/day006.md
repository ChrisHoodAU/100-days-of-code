# Functions & Karel, While Loops, Code Blocks

Functions
Lots of built in ones: round(), len(), etc

def function():
    print("Hello there")

function()

Indentation
Indenting is the signal that the code belongs to the function, loop, if statement etc
Style guide is 4 spaces. Boooooooo

While Loops
WHILE FOREVER CONSUME RAM

While a condition is true, do a thing
Can also do while not thing is true

For loops for iterating over something and you need to action each thing
While loops for doing something over and over until a condition changes - can chew a bunch of memory if you're not careful
