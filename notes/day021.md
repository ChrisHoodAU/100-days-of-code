# Inheritance, Slicing and Finishing Snake
Classes can inherit from other Classes
Slice lists, dicts

# Class Inheritance
Classes can inherit attributes or methods

# Slicing
Taking a chunk of a list or dict or tuple
piano_keys[2:5]
Slicing position is before the entry rather than after it - think one less than the number
[2:] is from position to the end
[:5] is from start to position
[2:5:2] third item sets the increment. 2 to 5, every second item.
[::2] every second item
[::-1] gets list in reverse order
