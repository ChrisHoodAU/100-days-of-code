# Day 1 
## Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String and Variables

### Printing
print("") or ('')
\n for a newline
You can't nest the same type of quote inside each other, but you can mix and match

### Strings
'+' to concatenate strings

### Indentation
Python is very strict on indentation. Significant whitespace.

### Inputs
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
Use input to grab inputs from the command line. Can nest into other functions

### Comments
Use the # for a single line
Or /# for multiline #/

### Variable Naming
Make variable names descriptive
Spaces aren't valid. Use _ instead
Can't have a variable start with a number
Shouldn't use built-in function names as variable names
