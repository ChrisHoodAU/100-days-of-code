# Object Oriented Programming

Procedural programming - one function to another from top to bottom

OOP - split program into small modules

Defining an Object: what is has; what it does;
Attributes, methods
Variables, functions

Class = blueprint
Object = instanciated Class

car = CarBlueprint() # use PascalCase. camelcase.

# Packages
Packages are many many related modules


# Instanciating the Menu Items
Only need to look at the functions in the class that do something.
